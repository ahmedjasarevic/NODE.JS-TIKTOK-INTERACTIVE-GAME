# TikTok Live Game: Ronaldo vs. Messi

Welcome to the TikTok Live Game, where you can witness the epic showdown between two football legends - Ronaldo and Messi - in real-time! This Node.js interactive game is designed for livestreams and leverages the power of the TikTok Live Connector for establishing a connection with your TikTok account. Here's a brief overview of the game:

## How It Works
1. **TikTok Live Connector**: We use the [TikTok Live Connector](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Live-Connector) to seamlessly connect your livestream to your TikTok account, making it possible for viewers to interact with the game.

2. **Ronaldo vs. Messi**: Choose your side and compete as either Ronaldo or Messi. Each player has a health bar that reflects their current status.

3. **Viewer Engagement**: Viewers can send TikTok gifts during the livestream, which will impact the health of their chosen player. Positive gifts add to the player's health, while negative gifts subtract from it.

4. **The Battle Unfolds**: As viewers engage with the game, watch the health bars of Ronaldo and Messi go up and down in real-time. The player with the most health at the end of the livestream wins!
